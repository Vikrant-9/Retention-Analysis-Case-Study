# Retention-Analysis-Case-Study
Introduction:
The goal of this data science project is to classify customers of a Spanish bank as potential defaulters or risky customers based on their historical loan and payment data. The project will utilize machine learning algorithms to analyze the bank's data and determine the likelihood of a customer defaulting on their loans in the future.

Data Collection:
The first step in this project is to gather the relevant data from the Spanish bank. This data will include information on the customers' loans, such as loan amount, interest rate, loan duration, and payment history. Other relevant information, such as the customers' demographic information, income, and employment status, will also be collected.

Data Cleaning:
Once the data has been collected, the next step is to clean and preprocess the data. This may involve removing any missing or duplicate data, normalizing the data, and converting categorical variables into numerical variables. The aim of this step is to ensure that the data is in a format suitable for analysis and that it accurately represents the information needed to classify the customers.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
The next step is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the data. This involves visualizing the data and identifying any patterns or relationships that may exist between the different variables. The EDA may include plots such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots, and will be used to gain insights into the data and identify any trends or anomalies that may be present.

Feature Engineering:
Based on the results of the EDA, the next step is to perform feature engineering, which involves creating new variables based on the existing data. This may involve calculating the loan-to-income ratio, the payment-to-income ratio, or other relevant metrics. The goal of this step is to create a set of variables that will be useful in predicting customer default risk.

Modeling:
Once the data has been cleaned, preprocessed, and analyzed, the next step is to build a machine learning model. This may involve selecting and testing different algorithms, such as decision trees, random forests, and logistic regression. The model will be trained on the data and will use the features created in the feature engineering step to predict the likelihood of a customer defaulting on their loans.

Evaluation:
The final step is to evaluate the model's performance. This may involve using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to determine the model's ability to correctly classify the customers as potential defaulters or non-defaulters. The model will also be tested on a set of hold-out data, which will allow for a more realistic assessment of its performance.

Conclusion:
This data science project has the potential to provide valuable insights into the loan default risk of the Spanish bank's customers. By utilizing machine learning algorithms to analyze the data, the project can provide a predictive model that can help the bank identify potential defaulters and take the necessary steps to minimize their risk of loan default. The end result will be a more effective risk management strategy for the bank, which will help ensure its financial stability and long-term success.
